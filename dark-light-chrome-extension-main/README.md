# dark-light-chrome-extension
A beautiful chrome extension to change theme from light to dark mode and vice versa

Most of the times our eyes get strained because of the light mode. Using the chrome default light/dark mode does not apply on certain web pages so in this project i have made a small project for cahnging the theme of webpages from light to dark and dark to light themes.
i have used basic HTML,CSS,javascript and chrome developers tool for this project where in manifest.json file i have asked permission from the browser to the tabs i am working on and inverted the color to its complementary color.
